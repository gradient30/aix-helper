  helpProviders: {
    what: "What is a Provider?",
    whatDesc: "A Provider is the connection profile an AI CLI uses to reach model services. It typically includes auth settings (API key / OAuth), base URL, and target app type.",
    whatTip: "You can configure multiple Providers per app. The first enabled Provider (by sort order) is used during export.",
    types: "Provider Types",
    typesDesc: "• Official Login: Prioritizes official endpoints and official auth flows\n• PackyCode: Third-party proxy preset with auto-filled base URL\n• Custom: Fully custom endpoint for enterprise gateway or self-hosted proxy",
    typesTip: "When using Official Login or PackyCode, the Base URL is auto-filled based on the selected app type.",
    howTo: "How to Configure?",
    howToDesc: "1. Click \"Add Provider\" and choose a preset template or fill in manually\n2. Select the target application (Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode)\n3. Enter API Key (can be left empty for Official Login)\n4. Custom type requires manual Base URL entry\n5. Toggle controls whether this Provider is included in exports\n6. Use the copy button to quickly clone existing configurations",
    test: "Connection Test",
    testDesc: "Click the test icon on a card to probe connectivity and auth semantics. The result explicitly distinguishes \"reachable but unauthorized\" from \"unreachable\".\n\n• Success: latency and status are returned\n• Failure: clear reason is shown (timeout / unauthorized / network unreachable, etc.)",
    testTip: "Connection test is a technical probe. Final usability should still be validated by running the local CLI workflow.",
  },
  helpMcp: {
    what: "What is an MCP Server?",
    whatDesc: "MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers expose callable capabilities to AI tools, such as file access, retrieval, browser automation, and external integrations.",
    whatTip: "MCP is an open protocol by Anthropic, adopted by Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and other tools.",
    transport: "Transport Types",
    transportDesc: "• Stdio (Standard I/O): Starts a local process via command, communicates through stdin/stdout. Best for most scenarios like npx-based MCP services\n• HTTP: Connects to a remote HTTP endpoint. For cloud-deployed MCP services\n• SSE (Server-Sent Events): Communicates via event streams. For real-time push scenarios",
    transportTip: "Most MCP Servers use Stdio. Choose HTTP or SSE for remotely deployed services.",
    templates: "Template Library",
    templatesDesc: "Built-in templates are strict-gated: 404 and deprecated presets are excluded. Every preset carries source_url, install method, and last_verified_at metadata.",
    templatesTip: "Templates are fully editable after creation. Templates marked as reference are recommended for test environments only.",
    env: "Environment Variables",
    envDesc: "Configure runtime environment variables for MCP Servers, such as:\n• API Token / Secret Key — for authentication\n• File paths — specify working directories\n• Database connection strings — specify data sources\n\nVariables are set as key-value pairs. Multiple variables supported.",
    envTip: "Use environment variables for sensitive info (API Keys) rather than hardcoding in command arguments.",
    bindings: "App Bindings",
    bindingsDesc: "Each MCP Server can be bound to one or more target apps (Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode).\n\n• Bound apps will include this MCP Server during app-specific export\n• Unbound apps won't include it\n• Full export always includes all MCP Servers regardless of bindings",
    bindingsTip: "Check all relevant apps if an MCP Server should be available across multiple tools.",
  },
  helpSkills: {
    what: "What are Skills?",
    whatDesc: "Skills are reusable instruction bundles. This platform separates scanable skill bundles (`repo_kind=skill_bundle`) from reference repositories (`repo_kind=reference_repo`) to prevent false imports.",
    whatTip: "Only `skill_bundle` repositories are allowed in scan/import flow. `reference_repo` entries are documentation-only.",
    repos: "Repository Management",
    reposDesc: "Repository presets track owner/repo, branch, subdirectory, and repo_kind. Presets are periodically verified for availability (404 / archived / rate-limit behavior).",
    reposTip: "Private repos may require GitHub API authorization. Public repos need no authentication.",
    scan: "Scan & Install",
    scanDesc: "1. Only repositories with `repo_kind=skill_bundle` can be scanned/imported\n2. The system lists child directories via GitHub API\n3. A directory is imported only if it contains `SKILL.md` (or `skill.md`)\n4. The first README.md text line is used as a short description when available\n5. Imported Skills appear in the \"Skills\" tab and can be installed/uninstalled via toggle",
    scanTip: "Scanning uses GitHub API. On 403 (rate limit/restricted access), the app retries automatically before returning a clear error. For large repos, set a subdirectory to reduce rate-limit risk.",
    views: "Official Alignment Policy",
    viewsDesc: "Codex Skills follow the official Agent Skills path model (`.agents/skills`). Gemini Skills commands are currently treated as unsupported until official stable command docs exist.",
  },
  helpPrompts: {
    what: "What are Prompts?",
    whatDesc: "Prompts are system prompt presets that guide AI CLI tool behavior and style. Different AI tools use different config files for system prompts. This platform provides unified management and app-specific export.",
    whatTip: "System prompts define AI behavior preferences, coding style, response language, etc. Proper configuration significantly improves the experience.",
    target: "Target File Mapping",
    targetDesc: "Each Prompt selects a target file that determines the exported filename:\n\n• CLAUDE.md → Claude Code — placed in project root, auto-loaded on startup\n• AGENTS.md → Codex / OpenCode — official project-level instruction file\n• GEMINI.md → Gemini CLI — Google Gemini CLI custom instructions\n• OPENCODE.md → OpenCode (compatibility target) — converted to AGENTS.md during OpenCode export",
    targetTip: "CLAUDE.md supports hierarchical loading: root-level applies globally, subdirectory-level applies only within that directory.",
    editor: "Editor Features",
    editorDesc: "Prompt content uses Markdown format, supporting:\n• Heading levels (# ## ###)\n• Lists (ordered/unordered)\n• Code blocks (inline and block)\n• Emphasis (bold/italic)\n• Links and quotes\n\nSwitch to the \"Preview\" tab for live Markdown rendering. Content limit: 50,000 characters.",
    editorTip: "Use clear heading structure to organize prompts: # Role Definition → # Coding Standards → # Output Format.",
    active: "Activation Management",
    activeDesc: "Each Prompt can be individually activated/deactivated:\n\n• Active Prompts are automatically used as target file content during app-specific export\n• Multiple Prompts can exist per target file, but only one should be active to avoid conflicts\n• Deactivated Prompts are preserved and can be reactivated anytime\n• The card toggle allows quick activation switching",
    activeTip: "Create multiple Prompts per tool (e.g., \"Daily Dev\", \"Code Review\", \"Doc Writing\") and switch activation by scenario.",
    optimizer: "Prompt Optimizer",
    optimizerDesc: "Built-in AI-powered prompt optimization to help you:\n• Analyze existing prompt structure and coverage\n• Auto-optimize wording and fill missing key instructions\n• Reorganize content following best practice templates\n• Support feedback and iteration on optimization results",
    optimizerTip: "The optimizer uses industry best practices, but final effectiveness depends on your use case. Review carefully before applying.",
  },
  helpExport: {
    what: "Export Overview",
    whatDesc: "Export generates CLI-readable file structures. The web app does not write directly into your local filesystem; you place exported files in official local paths.",
    whatTip: "App Export (ZIP) is the recommended method. Files strictly follow official CLI specs and are auto-recognized on CLI startup.",
    app: "App Export (ZIP)",
    appDesc: "Each CLI tool generates a ZIP with required config files:\n\n• Claude Code → settings.json ($schema + env{API Key/URL/Model} + permissions + mcpServers) + CLAUDE.md + skills/\n  Path: %USERPROFILE%\\.claude\\settings.json (Windows) or ~/.claude/settings.json (macOS/Linux)\n\n• Codex CLI → config.toml (top-level model/api_key + [mcp_servers.name]) + AGENTS.md\n  Path: %USERPROFILE%\\.codex\\config.toml (Windows) or ~/.codex/config.toml (macOS/Linux)\n\n• Gemini CLI → settings.json (mcpServers) + GEMINI.md\n  Path: user-level %USERPROFILE%\\.gemini\\settings.json (Windows) or ~/.gemini/settings.json (macOS/Linux); project-level ./.gemini/settings.json\n\n• OpenCode → opencode.json (mcpServers) + AGENTS.md\n  Path: global ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json; project-level ./opencode.json\n\nOnly exports: enabled Providers, app-bound MCP Servers, active Prompts, installed Skills.",
    appTip: "Before exporting, ensure Provider is enabled, MCP Servers are bound, Prompt is active, and Skills are installed.\n\nHigh-churn information (model versions, quotas, rate limits) is intentionally not hardcoded here. Always verify current values in official docs.",
    backup: "Data Backup",
    backupDesc: "Export all module data as JSON (internal fields like id/user_id/timestamps stripped), useful for:\n• Cross-account data migration\n• Data backup and restore\n• Bulk import within this app\n\n⚠️ Backup format is NOT a native CLI config format — do not place in CLI config directories.",
    backupTip: "Use the Import function to restore backup data within this app. Great for switching accounts or multi-device sync.",
    import: "Import Config",
    importDesc: "Restore data from JSON files, auto-detected by type:\n• Providers — contains provider_type field\n• MCP Servers — contains transport_type field\n• Prompts — contains target_file field\n\nImport appends records without overwriting existing data.",
    importTip: "Import files must be JSON arrays. Use the Data Backup feature to generate standard format files.",
    deepLink: "Deep Link Sharing",
    deepLinkDesc: "Generate a shareable link containing enabled Provider configs (excluding API Keys). Recipients can import with one click.",
    deepLinkTip: "Deep Links exclude sensitive info like API Keys. Recipients need to enter their own keys.",
